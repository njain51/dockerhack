### What is difference between Container and VM?

![img.png](../images/1_1.0_1.png)

For a typical VM to be used, you need a set of technology layers:

- The host machine and its operating system
- An application called a hypervisor that is installed on the host, and understands how to load and run the VM from an image file
- The VM’s environment, including the operating system running within the VM
- The runtime application and associated environment that run within the VM

A container’s resources for execution come from “carving out” a portion of the host operating system’s resources - grouping them in such a way that the container thinks it is running on its own system


###  How to run container with non root user

```text
	FROM alpine:3.8
	RUN adduser -D myuser
	USER myuser
	ENTRYPOINT [“sleep”]
	CMD [“1000”]
```

### What is Hypervisor?

- A hypervisor is hardware, software, or firmware capable of creating virtual machines and then managing and allocating resources to them
- Typically, when you want to replicate a virtual machine, you have to replicate its entire volume manually. Using a hypervisor, you can simply choose which virtual machines and parts you want replicated, and it will perform the process for you
- One of the main benefits of running virtual machines is if one of them crashes, it doesn’t affect the other virtual machines, or the main physical hardware or OS. This is because, although they use the same physical hardware, they’re logically separate from each other

### What can you tell about Docker Compose?
- It is a YAML file consisting of all the details regarding various services, networks, and volumes that are needed for setting up the Docker-based application. So, docker-compose is used for creating multiple containers, host them and establish communication between them.


### difference between save/load and export/import
- The difference between save/load and export/import is that the first one works with images including metadata, but the export/import combination uses only container layers and doesn't include any image metadata information such as name, tags, and so on. In most cases, the save/load combination is more relevant and works properly for images without special needs

- The docker save command packs the layers and metadata of all the chains required to build the image. You can then load this saved images chain into another Docker instance and create containers from these images.
### Differentiate between virtualization and containerization.

### Can you tell the difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?

-  CMD sets default command and/or parameters, which can be overwritten from command line when docker container runs. ENTRYPOINT command and parameters will not be overwritten from command line. Instead, all command line arguments will be added after ENTRYPOINT parameters

- The most commonly used ENTRYPOINT is /bin/sh or /bin/bash for most of the base images.

### Differentiate between COPY and ADD commands that are used in a Dockerfile?

- COPY provides just the basic support of copying local files into the container whereas **ADD provides additional features like remote URL and tar extraction support.**
- Both the commands have similar functionality, but **COPY is more preferred because of its higher transparency level** than that of ADD
