cgroups: A Linux Kernel feature that allows you to limit the access processes and containers have to system resources such as CPU, RAM, IOPS and network. 

- its one of fundamental aspects of Docker Container

Demo: 
we will try to limit cgroups and test it

(1) run a container with limited number of pid's: 

`docker run -itd --pids-limit 8 alpine`

(2)  Enter into container with exec command
`docker exec -it 4ef sh `
Note: if you are getting following error when running this command
_OCI runtime exec failed: exec failed: container_linux.go:349: starting container process caused "read init-p: connection reset by peer": unknown_
This means we have set limit value above too low for it. 

(3) Open new window to check docker stats: 
`docker stats 4efe7eb0b54a`
Output: it shows 3 pid currently running inside
CONTAINER ID        NAME                CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O           PIDS
4efe7eb0b54a        musing_cray         0.00%               1.086MiB / 15.64GiB   0.01%               1.09kB / 0B         0B / 0B             3

(4) Next, we will run following command inside container to generate more process: 

`/ # sleep 60 & sleep 60 & sleep 60 & sleep 60 & sleep 60 & sleep 60 & sleep 60`
sh: can't fork: Resource temporarily unavailable
/ #

We get above error since we have set resource limit of 8.Same we can observe from stats:

CONTAINER ID        NAME                CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O           PIDS
4efe7eb0b54a        musing_cray         0.00%               1.035MiB / 15.64GiB   0.01%               1.23kB / 0B         0B / 0B             8
