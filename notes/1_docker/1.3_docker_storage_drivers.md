A Docker storage driver is the main component to enable and manage container images. Two main technologies are used for that—copy-on-write and stackable image layers.

 
The most common storage drivers are AUFS, Overlay/Overlay2, Devicemapper, Btrfs, and ZFS. Allstorage drivers can be categorized into three different types:

**Storage driver category	Storage drivers**
Union filesystems	AUFS, Overlay, Overlay2
Snapshotting filesystems	Btrfs, ZFS
Copy-on-write block devices	Devicemapper

Overlay2 is preferred storage driver now in newer releases of docker. Read more here https://docs.docker.com/storage/storagedriver/select-storage-driver/
