# Docker Networking Concepts

#### Explain how Docker networking works:

- When we actually start a container, each container is connected to pvt virtual network called "bridge
- We can create our own network also like "Net-myapp" created in above diagram
- **Each virtual networks route through NAT firewall on host IP** which is docker daemon configuring host IP address on its interface so that container can get out to the interface to talk to rest of world and get back.
- All containers on same bridge or virtual network can talk to each other without -p.( C1 and C2 container which is part of same network above can talk freely without port.  But when C1 needs to talks to outside world it has to go through port 80 of host interface ( ethernet) only.
- Best practice is to create new virtual network for each related app
- Most defaults settings of containers are easily configurable
- **we can attach container to more than one virtual network.**
- we can also skip virtual network and use host IP ) --net=host)

#### How to know IP of running container:

```text
[root@dockervmfree ~]# docker inspect f9d --format '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}'
172.17.0.3
[root@dockervmfree ~]# docker inspect 459 --format '{{.NetworkSettings.IPAddress}}'
172.17.0.2

```
 

### how to list all networks: 

```text
[root@dockervmfree ~]# docker network ls
NETWORK ID     NAME      DRIVER    SCOPE
1c4133620515   bridge    bridge    local
a3a46d7ce276   host      host      local
1b13925e47ae   none      null      local

```
 

- bridge:Default Docker Virtual N/w which is NATed behind the host IP.
- host:it gains performance by skipping virtual network but compromises security or container model. 
- none : removes eth0 and only leaves you with localhost interface in container.
