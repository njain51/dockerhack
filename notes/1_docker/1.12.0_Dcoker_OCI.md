If we visit the /var/run/docker/containered directory where docker is installed,

- we will notice there are two additional unix sockets:

docker-containerd.sock
docker-containerd-debug.sock
```

##### What is Containered? 


- [containerd](https://containerd.io/) is an **industry-standard core container runtime** with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness and portability. It is **available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle of its host system: image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage and network attachments, etc..**



- Note: Traditionally, a computer programmer might know "runtime" as either the lifecycle phase when a program is running, or the specific implementation of a language that supports its execution.A container runtime is responsible for all the parts of running a container that isn't actually running the program itself.

- Docker has been using containerd as its “engine” since the v1.11 release.
- **Containerd is an Open Container Initiative (OCI) implementation, allowing you to choose the runtime for your containers (the default for Docker being runC)**

- [The Docker v1.11 release announcement](https://blog.docker.com/2016/04/docker-engine-1-11-runc/) has a good diagram to illustrate how this all fits together:

- So when user interacts with Docker enginer through Docker Command Line, Docker engine will communicates with Contained. And Contained is OCI implementation, and in Docker case its runC which will help spin containers. 


##### Low-Level and High-Level Container Runtimes

![img.png](../images/3.5.3.png)

- When folks think of container runtimes, a list of examples might come to mind; runc, lxc, lmctfy, Docker (containerd), rkt, cri-o. Each of these is built for different situations and implements different features. Some, like containerd and cri-o, actually use runc to run the container but implement image management and APIs on top. You can think of these features -- which include image transport, image management, image unpacking, and APIs -- as high-level features as compared to runc's low-level implementation.

- So for practical purposes, actual container runtimes that focus on just running containers are usually referred to as "low-level container runtimes". Runtimes that support more high-level features, like image management and gRPC/Web APIs, are usually referred to as "high-level container tools", "high-level container runtimes" or usually just "container runtimes". I'll refer to them as "high-level container runtimes". It's important to note that low-level runtimes and high-level runtimes are fundamentally different things that solve different problems.

- Containers are implemented using Linux namespaces and cgroups. Namespaces let you virtualize system resources, like the file system or networking, for each container. Cgroups provide a way to limit the amount of resources like CPU and memory that each container can use. At the lowest level, container runtimes are responsible for setting up these namespaces and cgroups for containers, and then running commands inside those namespaces and cgroups. Low-level runtimes support using these operating system features.

- Typically, developers who want to run apps in containers will need more than just the features that low-level runtimes provide. They need APIs and features around image formats, image management, and sharing images. These features are provided by high-level runtimes. Low-level runtimes just don't provide enough features for this everyday use. For that reason the only folks that will actually use low-level runtimes would be developers who implement higher level runtimes, and tools for containers.

- Developers who implement low-level runtimes will say that higher level runtimes like containerd and cri-o are not actually container runtimes, as from their perspective they outsource the implementation of running a container to runc. But, from the user's perspective, they are a singular component that provides the ability to run containers. One implementation can be swapped out for another, so it still makes sense to call it a runtime from that perspective. **Even though containerd and cri-o both use runc, they are very different projects that have very different feature support.**
