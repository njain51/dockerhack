# Modifying Shared files from inside Container 

**Scenario:**
- Our application required root access on container. 
- This container is also mounting /tmp host directory to container.
- An attacker compromised this application and got root access on container. Now, since attacker got root access so he can now modify host files in the /tmp diectory. 

**Demo**

- For this we are using Rancher Desktop installation with `dockered` selection
- also we need to start Docker Desktop so that Rancher can use Docker engine for running commands
- check docker running on windows:

```

- Create tmp on windows: D:\mylearning\in_progress\dockerfiles\tmp
- create file.txt here with following content: 
```text
echo " this file is on my desktop " > file.txt
```

- run a container with path mounted to shared volume
```text
docker run -itd -v "D:\mylearning\in_progress\dockerfiles\tmp":/shared alpine
```

- enter into container:
```text
winpty docker exec -it  75a1be04c479 sh
```
- within container first we verify permission of file.txt and id 
```text
/ # cd /shared
/shared # ls -lrt
total 0
-rwxrwxrwx    1 root     root            71 Apr 16 17:25 file.txt

/shared # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy),20(dialout),26(tape),27(video)

```
- now modify file.txt @/shared path and save and exit 
- 
- When we check file contents again on local it will be modified
```text
NitinJain@DESKTOP-N38RJ75 MINGW64 /d/mylearning/in_progress/dockerfiles/tmp
$ cat file.txt
 this file is on my desktop  - adding additional lines from containerâ–’
```

### How to prevent it from occurring: 

- Note this workaround worked for me on linux machine only as `Docker Desktop` doesn't give many options to start from commandline. 
- We can prevent above scenario by enabling user namespaces for docker daemon
  - root inside container is run in separate context that is different from host
  - root of container is different from root of host.

```text
docker stop $(docker ps -aq)
docker rm $(docker ps -aq)
sudo systemctl stop docker
sudo systemctl stop docker.socket
sudo dockerd --userns-remap=default &
```

- ```docker run -it -v /tmp:/shared alpine /bin/sh``` 
error
```text
Cannot start container: Getting the final child's pid from pipe caused "EOF"
```
Resolution:
```text
sysctl -w user.max_user_namespaces=15000
```

- Once in container we can check permission of file.txt again:
```text
total 4
-rw-r--r--    1 nobody   nobody          51 Apr 16 18:19 file.txt
```
- Now we are able to prevent root owned files to be overwritten by container
